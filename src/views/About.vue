    <h1>About NOTE MARK</h1>
    <br><br>
    <p>Note mark is an application that will help you create study notes using markdown.
      What makes it useful is we can save these notes along with multiple tags(like hashtags) so you can search the notes effeciently using these tags.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>When you are creating the note, you do not need to use hashtags just add them as normal words</li>
      <li>When searching however you can use names and tags both</li>
      <li>Just type the name of the note and it will appear</li>
      <li>But, to use the tag place a hash symbol before it. Say if the tag is project, you will seach as #project</li>
    </ul>
